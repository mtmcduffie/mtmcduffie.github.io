                        Through different funding mechnisms and organizations within the HMS eco-system I contributed both directly on software and data projects as well an advisory capacity to faculty members, directors and executives. Most recently I have been assisting the active director of technology in growing a group to aid department wide development efforts. To this end I have worked directly on building AuthN/AuthZ/Registration systems to alleviate user management problems across our suite of tools. <br /><br />
                        
                        Previously in my position at Boston Childrenâ€™s Hospital within Dr. Avillach's Lab I had helped build and lead a team of software developers on concurrent biomedical informatics infrastructure projects. Our aim was to unify diverse sets of data, either through a single research data warehouse or distributed resources with their own unique underlying system. Our primary implementation involved the java based tranSMART and i2b2 platforms built in an automated AWS HIPAA compliant environment. The completed warehouses would be used to conduct research ranging from genotypic and phenotypic correlation to computational phenotyping. <br /><br />

                        My work primarily focused on enhancing and implementing the tranSMART platform. This application was using the Grails framework on top of the Java platform and is compatible with both Oracle and PostgreSQL databases. We utilized agile methodologies to iterate with our clients on their requests. <br /><br />
